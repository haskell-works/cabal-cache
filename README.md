Tool for caching built cabal new-build packages.

The tool is useful in development when you want to share your build haskell package dependencies of
of a particular project with another developer and also in CI where caching is useful for reducing
build times.

`cabal-cache` supports syncing to an archive directory or to an S3 bucket.

## Installation

Several installation methods are available.

### From source

```bash
cabal new-install cabal-cache
```

### Ubuntu binaries

Dowload Ubuntu binaries from https://github.com/haskell-works/cabal-cache/releases

### Using Homebrew on Mac OS X

```bash
brew tap haskell-works/homebrew-haskell-works git@github.com:haskell-works/homebrew-haskell-works.git
brew update
brew install cabal-cache
```

## Example usage

Syncing built packages with S3 requires you have an S3 bucket with AWS
credentials stored in the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environent variables.
You should also know the AWS region the bucket was created in.

### Sync to archive

Change into your project directory.

Build the project with `cabal v2-build`.  This will ensure your dependencies are built and
will product a `plan.json` file that is required for the `cabal-cache` tool to know which built
packages to sync up.

Run the following command to sync to S3.

```bash
cabal-cache sync-to-archive --threads 16 --archive-uri s3://my-cabal-cache-bucket/archive --region Sydney
```

Run the following command to sync to archive directory.

```bash
cabal-cache sync-to-archive --threads 16 --archive-uri archive --region Sydney
```

### Sync from S3

Change into your project directory.

Build the project with `cabal v2-configure`.  This will product a `plan.json` file that is required
for the `cabal-cache` tool to know which built packages to sync down.

Run the following command to sync from S3.

```bash
cabal-cache sync-from-archive --threads 16 --archive-uri s3://my-cabal-cache-bucket/archive --region Sydney
```

Run the following command to sync from archive directory.

```bash
cabal-cache sync-from-archive --threads 16 --archive-uri archive --region Sydney
```

## Caveats

### Paths_$pgkname modules

`Paths_$pkgname` modules have embedded within them the absolute path to the package in the cabal store
which strictly means that packages are not relocatable.  It is recommended that you use a fixed cabal
store path rather than the default `$HOME/.cabal/store` to avoid any potential issues.
